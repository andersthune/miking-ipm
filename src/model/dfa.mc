-- Represents a deterministic finite automaton.
-- Equality and print functions are required for the states (eqv,s2s) and labels (eql,l2s) for the 
-- construct function (dfaConstr).

-- States are represented by a vertex in a directed graph. They are unique integers, there cannot be two states whose value of the
-- equality function is true.

-- transitions are represented as edges in a directed graph (digraph), where the vertices are states
-- All labels for the transitions are chars. All labels between two states also has to be unique.
